/**
 * Demonstrates the usage of the java.util.function.Predicate interface.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - To create and use the Predicate interface, it is NOT essential to use lambda expressions. Get the concept first
 * - It helps if you understand a bit of mathematical concept of predicate
 * - Put in plain English(from Schildt's book) a Predicate<T>:
 determines if an object of type T fulfills some constraint. Returns a boolean value that indicates the outcome. Its method is called test().
